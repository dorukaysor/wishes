I want to create a dynamic responsive website to wish someone happy birthday. After I send the person the website link and he/she opens it, the wesite will wish them Happy Birthday in an elegant manner with various graphics, animations and transitions. After hat the website would show a responsive text area for the person to describe/write their desired wish into the textarea. After that again wish them Happy Birthday.

Then send me the wished text back and store it in the storage space.

I want it to be hosted on vercel.



file system:

website/
|- assets/
| |- images/
| |- gifs/
| |- videos/
|
|- manage/
| |- index.html
| |- settings.json
|
|- index.html
|- vercel.json



Notes for filesystem:
- "website/assets/" folder contains all the assets for the website i.e images, videos, gifs.
- "website/manage/index.html" is the webpage with admin login feature through which the admin can configure global settings for the website.
- "website/manage/settings.json" contains all the global settings for the website.
- "website/index.html" is the main webpage file.
- "website/vercel.json" is the vercel app configuration
